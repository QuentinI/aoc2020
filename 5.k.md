### L1: Preparing the input

Read input:

```k
0:"5.in"
    ("BFFFBFFRLR"
     "FBBBFFBRRL"
     ...)
```

Partially applied `=` (`=[...]`) applied to "R", same as `"R"=...`

```k
=["FFBBBBBLRL"]"R" 
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
```

 Map (`'`) partially applied `=` to every character in "RB"

```k
=["FFBBBBBLRL"]'"RB"
    (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
     0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0)
```

 Reduce (`/`) the result with max (`|`), which is equivalent to OR for binary vectors

```k
|/=["FFBBBBBLRL"]'"RB"
    0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0
```

 Make scalar from base-2 vector

```k
2 _sv |/=["FFBBBBBLRL"]'"RB"
    250
```

 For each (`'`) line in input apply previous expression as anonymous function, `{...}` automatically makes available first three arguments as `x`,`y` and `z`

```k
{2 _sv |/=[x]'"RB"}'0:"5.in"
    549 462 167 ...
```

 Assign result to S

```k
S:{2 _sv |/=[x]'"RB"}'0:"5.in"
    549 462 167 ...
```

### L2: Answer to part 1

 Reduce ('/') S with max ('|')

```k
|/S
    955
```

### L3: Answer to part 2

"Grade down" S, gives array of indices to S which sort it

```k
<S
    100 748 752 ...
```

S indexed by (`@`) its grade down, i.e is sorted S

```k
S@<S
    71 72 73 74 ...
```

 Map `-` to each pair (`':`) in sorted S

```k
 {-':x}S@<S
    1 1 1 ... 1 2 1 1 ...
```

 Find index of 2 (`?2`) in the result

```k
{(-':x)?2}S@<S
    497
```

 Index by it...

```k
{x@(-':x)?2}S@<S
    568
```

And add one

```k
1+{x@(-':x)?2}S@<S
    569
```
